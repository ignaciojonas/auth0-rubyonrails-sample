# Authorization
[Full Tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/rails/07-authorization)

This example shows one of the ways of adding Authorization for a resource in your Rails app. There is an admin page, which is only accessible for users with the admin role.

## Running the Sample Application
In order to run the example you need to have ruby installed.

You also need to set the ClientSecret, ClientId, Domain and CallbackURL for your Auth0 app as environment variables with the following names respectively: `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL`.

For that, if you just create a file named `.env` in the project directory and set the values as follows, the app will just work:

````bash
# .env file
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=myCoolSecret
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=myCoolClientId
AUTH0_DOMAIN=samples.auth0.com
AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/oauth2/callback
````
__Note:__ Remember to use `https` in the callback URL of your Production Environment.
Once you've set those 4 environment variables, run `bundle install` and then `rails s`. Now, browse [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

__Note:__ If you are using Windows, uncomment the `tzinfo-data` gem in the gemfile.
