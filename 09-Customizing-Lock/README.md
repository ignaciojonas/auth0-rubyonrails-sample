# Customizing Lock
[Full Tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/rails/09-customizing-lock)

This example shows how to customize the Lock widget, as it is oftentimes required to update it to match the look and feel of your app.

## Running the Sample Application
In order to run the example you need to have ruby installed.

You also need to set the ClientSecret, ClientId, Domain and CallbackURL for your Auth0 app as environment variables with the following names respectively: `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL`.

Set the environment variables in `.env` to match those your Auth0 Client.

````bash
# .env file
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=myCoolClientId
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=myCoolSecret
AUTH0_DOMAIN=samples.auth0.com
AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/oauth2/callback
````
__Note:__ Remember to use `https` in the callback URL of your Production Environment.
Once you've set those 4 environment variables, run `bundle install` and then `rails s`. Now, browse [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
__Note:__ Remember that you need to have `./bin` in your path for `rails s` to work.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

__Note:__ If you are using Windows, uncomment the `tzinfo-data` gem in the gemfile.
